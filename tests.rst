 -----Testing Jupyterhub and Linting code-----
  
 
  - Unit tests help to confirm that JupyterHub works just the way it is supposed to work and does so even when the modifications are made. They also communicates
    expectations from our code. JupyterHub uses `pytest <https://pytest.org>`_ for all the tests.You can find them under the                                                      `jupyterhub/tests <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/tree/main/jupyterhub/tests>`_ directory in the git repository.
